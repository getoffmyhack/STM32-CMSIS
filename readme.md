# STM32 CMSIS Build Environment

This is a repackaging of the STM32 CMSIS build files included with [STMCube] (http://www.st.com/en/embedded-software/stm32cube-mcu-packages.html) package.  I am creating this repository as a bare minimum build environment for the STM32 line of ARM Cortex-M micro controllers.  Currently, this repository only includes the STM32F1xx Cube package.
